# Shark tank R Shiny Project

Hi there! I'm Joy Zhang, and I'm truly passionate about leveraging data to make smart investment decisions. This project leverages the Kaggle Shark Tank dataset to create a Shiny app to analyze the investment patterns and outcomes of the show.

- Sharks' Analysis: Examines "Shark Tank" sharks' investment patterns by industry, gender, geographical distribution, deal closure rates, and TV viewership influence.

- Pitchers' Analysis: Analyzes pitches using scatterplots for initial and final amounts and equity, with histograms comparing viewership for successful and unsuccessful pitches, and treemaps showing industry and shark distributions.

- Interactive Visuals: Offers interactive scatterplots, treemaps, and histograms to explore data on pitches and deals, focusing on industry involvement, deal quality, and viewership trends.

- Data Access and Search Tool: Provides a searchable data table for detailed historical deal data by season, episode, and shark, facilitating easy access to investment records.

- Predictive Modeling and Analysis: Uses logistic regression to forecast pitch outcomes with a maximum accuracy of 0.6, highlighting the challenges and constraints in prediction.


## Data

This section talks about the dataset used in the project:

- Dataset Overview: The dataset contains information from 15 seasons of Shark Tank US, with over 1330 records and 53 fields. It provides a rich data source for analyzing the show's investment patterns and outcomes.

- Pitch and Deal Details: The dataset captures specifics about entrepreneur pitches, including original asks and equity offerings, alongside the outcome of each deal. This detailed information allows for a thorough analysis of what factors contribute to successful pitches.

- Shark Participation: It details individual shark investments and their presence in episodes, along with contributions from guest sharks. This helps in understanding the investment preferences and tendencies of different sharks.

- Viewership and Accessibility: The dataset includes US viewership ratings and provides links to the company websites featured in pitches. This data helps in analyzing the correlation between pitch success and TV viewership and provides an accessible way to explore the featured companies.
